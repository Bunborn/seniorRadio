Project to make an accessible device for internet radio

The goal of the project is to use a raspberry pi zero w to stream internet radio with simple controls for use with those needing accesbility to access these streams. Specifically, this project is for my vision-impaired grandpa :)

Instructions for setting up the Rpi into headless mode, loading the software, and creating the physical IO is online at (TBD)
